							<p>What is Neo Futurism?</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> Neo-futurism is a late-20th/early-21st century architectural style. It evolved out of high-tech architecture, developing many of the same themes and ideas. It is seen as a departure from the more skeptical and referential style of post-modernism, and more of an idealistic approach to the future. It aims to rethink the aesthetics and functionality of rapidly growing urban areas.

The movement has its origins in the mid-20th century structural expressionist work of the Finnish architects Alvar Aalto and Eero Saarinen, as well as the Danish architects Henning Larsen and Jorn Utzon, and other pioneers such as Buckminster Fuller. </p>
							<p>The overall aesthetic of neo-futuristic architectural design can sometimes be seen as a rejection of pessimism and a reaching outwards toward a positive vision of the future. That is why much of the neo-futuristic architecture around today could resemble the domes and habitats drawn onto the covers of sci-fi magazines, or the cityscapes of futuristic movie sets. But neo-futurism is much more than a fascination with science and technology; it is also an avant-garde movement.</p>
